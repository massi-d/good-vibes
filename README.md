# Good Vibes

Here is my demonstration project for people interested in my skills.

## How to start the project:
Download the frontend at the top of the page and do an ``ng serve`` in the source code. 

Run the api in parallel and do an ```node app.js``` in the [source code]() to download.

For data persistence, it is a **serverless** database with **MongoDB Atlas**.
